# SUMMARY
This AI-powered application analyzes the uploaded photos of users to determine their face shapes and provides personalized hairstyle recommendations.
In this way, users can easily find the most suitable hairstyle for their face shape. The system examines various features of the face to classify the face shape and matches it with predefined hairstyles.

This project aims to accelerate users' decision-making processes in hairstyle selection and help them make the right choice.
